# HATE_speech_detection
Developed during my internship, this hate speech detection project aimed to understand classifiers and handle large datasets for training and testing. I achieved 87% accuracy and tested the model on unseen data. It provided valuable insights into machine learning, text preprocessing, and evaluation, strengthening my NLP skills.
